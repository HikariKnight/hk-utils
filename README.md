# HikariKnight Utilities
Pubilc repository with custom tools for my personal setup.
Scripts inside this repository install to /usr/local/bin and may rely on other repositories or tools to function.

Depending on the task of the script they are written in either Bash or Python.

Scripts are publicly available in the hopes that they will be useful for others
